  <summary>A quantitative screener for the relative valuation of global stocks</summary>

  <description>
    <p>
      Aethelon is a tool for relative stock analysis. It does not calculate a "fair value" but answers the question: "Which companies, compared to all others in the analysis universe, are currently the most attractive based on my chosen strategy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The app analyzes a universe of nearly 200 global companies across 6 fundamental dimensions (Quality, Value, Growth, Momentum, Dividend, Safety) and allows the user to sort the results based on predefined investment styles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Important Note:</b> The analysis is purely quantitative and does not account for qualitative, forward-looking risks such as disruptive technological changes.
